I am a PhD student in Computer Science at [Vanderbilt University](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/) under the supervision of Dr. [Tyler Derr](https://tylersnetwork.github.io/) and a member of the [Network and Data Science (NDS) lab](https://nds-vu.github.io/). Before joining Vandy, I will have completed my BS and MS in Computer Science from [Huazhong University of Science and Technology](https://www.hust.edu.cn/) in 2018 and 2021, respectively, where I received the university’s “Outstanding Graduate” award for both my BS degree and MS degree.

## **Research Interest**
My interest lies in graph mining. I am fascinated by the powerful representation ability of graphs. I am broadly interested in analyzing all kinds of graph data, ranging from social media networks, coauthorship relationships, biology graphs, and so on. My current research focus is dynamic graph learning. I have conducted researches on influence maximization and plan to use machine learning techniques to further explore this field. Instead of focusing on the theoretical guarantee, I hope to see what other interesting patterns and contents can be driven from the diffusion process to better understand human behavior. For example, learn how the influence between two individuals might change.
