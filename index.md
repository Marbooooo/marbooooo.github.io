I am a 2nd year PhD student in Computer Science at University of Virginia. My advisor is [Hongning Wang](http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~hw5x/). I am broadly interested in machine learning and its applications to information retrieval and data mining. My Current research focus: contextual bandits in non-stationary, multi-agent settings.

I received my Bachelor degree and Master degree from Harbin Institute of Technology in 2016 and 2018, respectively.
